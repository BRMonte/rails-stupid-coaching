 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css, which will include all the files
 * listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file
 * and they'll appear at the bottom of the compiled file so the styles add here
 * take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS files in this directory.
 * Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
